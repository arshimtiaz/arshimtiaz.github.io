<h1 id="my-first-wi-fi-pentest">My First Wi-Fi Pentest</h1>
<p>There’s a massive difference between watching pentesting videos and actually doing it. This was my first time seriously trying Wi-Fi pentesting, and it was a mix of pure excitement, a bunch of silly mistakes, and that one moment of “YES! It finally worked.”</p>

In this post, I’ll walk you through the process with practical commands for both Arch Linux and Debian users.</p>]]></description>
