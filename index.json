This was my first time seriously trying Wi-Fi pentesting, and it was a mix of pure excitement, a bunch of silly mistakes, and that one moment of “YES! It finally worked.” Disclaimer: This is just my story, not a tutorial. Everything I did was on my own network. Don’t go around trying this on random Wi-Fi unless you like the idea of explaining yourself to law enforcement.
