Having worked with test cars before, I got an insight into how time consuming and expensive, if not difficult it is to set a working HIL (Hardware-In-Loop) setup. I didn’t want to wait for hardware to understand how automotive networks behave - I wanted to simulate it. So, I built my own virtual car hacking network using Linux tools, a bit of Python, and some creative problem solving.

Being extremely niche, it isn’t the first thing that comes to mind when someone thinks of cybersecurity. They imagine computers, massive server farms and a network that connects them all. But what is a modern car, if not a network of highly powerful computers, on wheels. Working with cars as a pentester has had me dealing with security at the intersection of software and hardware - but I wanted to explore the same logic on my own terms. A vehicle’s network is split into three specific interfaces: CAN (Controller Area Network) - the most widely used LIN (Local Interconnect Network) - for low-speed/low-cost devices Automotive Ethernet (100BASE-T1, 1000BASE-T1, etc.) - higher bandwidth, growing adoption Infotainment Systems, Sensors, ECUs, they all talk over these buses. Setting these up requires a lot of specialized hardware and software. This includes purchasing an expensive license with the already expensive hardware which is designed to simulate and control such networks. (Yes Vector, I’m talking about you). These tools are brilliant, but they’re practically out of reach when you’re hacking solo and not backed by a corporation. So: emulate it.

After all, ECUs are basically computers that run a specific piece of software or a specific operating system on them, designed to only perform specific tasks. In a world where we have virtual machines helping us run multiple computers on one, I started brainstorming if it was possible to create ECUs digitally, without all the fancy expensive hardware. What would you possibly need? GPS? Wi-Fi? Bluetooth? A platform to run apps and scripts? A logger? All of this already exists on a standard laptop. The only thing that stood out to me was the communication interfaces. CAN is not used anywhere apart from automotive networks. Neither is LIN or 100Base-T1 (Automotive Ethernet for a reason). This made me research even more. What could possibly help me simulate CAN? “If there’s a will, there is a way.” ~ some wise person ","date":"2025-11-09","objectID":"/posts/virtual-vehicle-lab/:2:0","tags":["wifi","Homelab","cybersecurity","pentesting","networking"],"title":"When Red Teaming Meets Car Hacking: Building a Virtual Vehicle Pentest Lab on My Laptop","uri":"/posts/virtual-vehicle-lab/"},{"categories":null,"content":"The Build After a bit of research, I came across SocketCAN. It’s a Linux kernel subsystem that exposes CAN interfaces like any other network device. Think CAN, but now it runs pretty much anywhere. It allows us to create virtual CAN interfaces on Linux, or connect to physical CAN networks present on an actual car. It doesn’t have anything to do with what flavour you choose as it is built into the kernel. It is only a matter flipping the switch and enabling it: sudo modprobe vcan This will help enable the vcan (virtual CAN) interface module. After this, you can create the virtual CAN interface: sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan sudo ip link set up vcan0 Run this to confirm if you’ve got it: ifconfig vcan0: flags=193\u003cUP,RUNNING,NOARP\u003e mtu 72 unspec 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00 txqueuelen 1000 (UNSPEC) RX packets 0 bytes 0 (0.0 B) RX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 frame 0 TX packets 0 bytes 0 (0.0 B) TX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0 And voila!

To send packets on this interface, we have a set of can tools that you can install on pretty much any Linux machine as well. I use the Blackarch repository on my Arch Linux machine. If you’re on Debian, you can use Kali Linux’s repository for the same. Both of them contain the package we want to install. Fedora users please don’t come after me Arch Linux: sudo pacman -Syu sudo pacman -S can-utils # tools for working with CAN Debian: sudo apt-get update \u0026\u0026 apt-get upgrade sudo apt-get install can-utils This will give you access to these tools: candump cansend canplayer cansniffer …and more. To send packets on the virtual bus (vcan0), use this command: cansend vcan0 123#AABBCCDDEEFF If it doesn’t output anything, congratulations! You’ve sent your first CAN frame using Linux! But… how do we know that it got sent? We can use candump, which continuously listens for any CAN messages being transmitted on the bus you specify to it as an argument. candump vcan0 While this is running, send the example CAN frame with cansend from another terminal again. This time, you’ll see it pop up on the listener as a properly formatted CAN frame: vcan0 123 [6] AA BB CC DD EE FF Brilliant. You’ve now mastered the art of sending CAN frames on a bus using Linux, and only Linux. What makes this fun is you can also build your own custom logger and transmitter using Python, with the python-can library. It can both send and listen for CAN frames on any CAN interface. Here’s one if you want to try it out: #!/usr/bin/env python3 import can import time import threading def receiver(bus): \"\"\"Receive and print CAN messages.\"\"\" print(\"[Receiver] Listening for CAN messages...\") for msg in bus: print(f\"[Received] ID: {msg.arbitration_id:#04x}, Data: {msg.data.hex().upper()}\") def sender(bus): \"\"\"Send CAN messages periodically.\"\"\" print(\"[Sender] Starting message transmission...\") msg = can.Message(arbitration_id=0x123, data=[0x11, 0x22, 0x33, 0x44], is_extended_id=False) while True: try: bus.send(msg) print(f\"[Sent] ID: {msg.arbitration_id:#04x}, Data: {msg.data.hex().upper()}\") time.sleep(1) except can.CanError: print(\"[Error] Message not sent\") def main(): # Connect to virtual CAN interface bus = can.interface.Bus(channel=\"vcan0\", bustype=\"socketcan\") # Start receiver in background thread recv_thread = threading.Thread(target=receiver, args=(bus,), daemon=True) recv_thread.start() # Start sending messages sender(bus) if __name__ == \"__main__\": main() This simple program lets you prototype virtual ECUs that send/receive frames — perfect for building test scenarios.

This completely virtualizes the test bench and makes it portable. The presence of Python (python-can) allows us to craft custom CAN packets, which opens doors to creating a fuzzer that mutates CAN frames randomly. All of this put together gives us a basic, but robust virtual car, which can be used to practice pentesting and diagnostics(Enter, UDS). I can safely test security features without messing with actual hardware(did I tell you it was very expensive?). I can practice IDS detection in Wazuh or Suricata by integrating the CAN logs. Train myself and others without physical ECUs. Hacking isn’t about fancy gear. It’s about creativity. By virtualizing this challenge, I learned more about CAN networks, Linux Networking, and the hacker mindset in itself.
