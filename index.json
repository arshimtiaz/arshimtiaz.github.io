[{"categories":null,"content":" Modelling broken access control in a small transaction system Why build another lab? Broken access control (especially IDOR-style issues) keeps showing up in real systems – often in places that look “boring” on the surface: balance checks, transaction history, admin tools, internal APIs. I wanted a small, opinionated lab that behaves more like the systems I see in the real world than a typical CTF challenge. Something I could: use to explain attack paths to engineers, talk through in interviews without referencing client work, and extend over time with new scenarios. So I built a Transaction System Attack Lab – a tiny, multi-service platform that exposes a very real class of bug: object-level authorization failures on account data.

Extensibility – The roadmap includes future scenarios like webhook issues, race conditions on transfers, and misuse of internal tooling. I can grow this over time as I see more real-world patterns.

It doesn’t have anything to do with what flavour you choose as it is built into the kernel. It is only a matter flipping the switch and enabling it: sudo modprobe vcan This will help enable the vcan (virtual CAN) interface module. After this, you can create the virtual CAN interface: sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan sudo ip link set up vcan0 Run this to confirm if you’ve got it: ifconfig vcan0: flags=193\u003cUP,RUNNING,NOARP\u003e mtu 72 unspec 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00 txqueuelen 1000 (UNSPEC) RX packets 0 bytes 0 (0.0 B) RX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 frame 0 TX packets 0 bytes 0 (0.0 B) TX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0 And voila!

To send packets on this interface, we have a set of can tools that you can install on pretty much any Linux machine as well. I use the Blackarch repository on my Arch Linux machine. If you’re on Debian, you can use Kali Linux’s repository for the same. Both of them contain the package we want to install. Fedora users please don’t come after me Arch Linux: sudo pacman -Syu sudo pacman -S can-utils # tools for working with CAN Debian: sudo apt-get update \u0026\u0026 apt-get upgrade sudo apt-get install can-utils This will give you access to these tools: candump cansend canplayer cansniffer …and more. To send packets on the virtual bus (vcan0), use this command: cansend vcan0 123#AABBCCDDEEFF If it doesn’t output anything, congratulations! You’ve sent your first CAN frame using Linux! But… how do we know that it got sent? We can use candump, which continuously listens for any CAN messages being transmitted on the bus you specify to it as an argument. candump vcan0 While this is running, send the example CAN frame with cansend from another terminal again. This time, you’ll see it pop up on the listener as a properly formatted CAN frame: vcan0 123 [6] AA BB CC DD EE FF Brilliant. You’ve now mastered the art of sending CAN frames on a bus using Linux, and only Linux. What makes this fun is you can also build your own custom logger and transmitter using Python, with the python-can library. It can both send and listen for CAN frames on any CAN interface. Here’s one if you want to try it out: #!/usr/bin/env python3 import can import time import threading def receiver(bus): \"\"\"Receive and print CAN messages.\"\"\" print(\"[Receiver] Listening for CAN messages...\") for msg in bus: print(f\"[Received] ID: {msg.arbitration_id:#04x}, Data: {msg.data.hex().upper()}\") def sender(bus): \"\"\"Send CAN messages periodically.\"\"\" print(\"[Sender] Starting message transmission...\") msg = can.Message(arbitration_id=0x123, data=[0x11, 0x22, 0x33, 0x44], is_extended_id=False) while True: try: bus.send(msg) print(f\"[Sent] ID: {msg.arbitration_id:#04x}, Data: {msg.data.hex().upper()}\") time.sleep(1) except can.CanError: print(\"[Error] Message not sent\") def main(): # Connect to virtual CAN interface bus = can.interface.Bus(channel=\"vcan0\", bustype=\"socketcan\") # Start receiver in background thread recv_thread = threading.Thread(target=receiver, args=(bus,), daemon=True) recv_thread.start() # Start sending messages sender(bus) if __name__ == \"__main__\": main() This simple program lets you prototype virtual ECUs that send/receive frames — perfect for building test scenarios.

This completely virtualizes the test bench and makes it portable. The presence of Python (python-can) allows us to craft custom CAN packets, which opens doors to creating a fuzzer that mutates CAN frames randomly. All of this put together gives us a basic, but robust virtual car, which can be used to practice pentesting and diagnostics(Enter, UDS). I can safely test security features without messing with actual hardware(did I tell you it was very expensive?). I can practice IDS detection in Wazuh or Suricata by integrating the CAN logs. Train myself and others without physical ECUs. Hacking isn’t about fancy gear. It’s about creativity.

I work as a Cyber Security Engineer, mostly living in the space between penetration testing, secure architecture review, cloud and platform security, and automotive cybersecurity. I enjoy understanding how complex systems fail, how attackers think, and how to build things that don’t fall apart under pressure. I am based in Coventry, UK. I’m not really a “just run tools” kind of person. I like digging into systems, protocols, logs, and strange behaviours until I actually understand what’s going on. That curiosity pretty much shaped my entire career.

Some days I’m deep in threat modelling, trust-boundary analysis, or regulatory security verification. Other days I’m testing protocols, writing PoCs, analysing logs, or figuring out why a system behaves weirdly under certain inputs. I’ve worked across automotive platforms, embedded systems, Linux environments, cloud infrastructure, and distributed software. That mix has taught me how to look at security from an engineering perspective, not just from a testing one. If you want the career-version of this story, it’s all on my LinkedIn profile.
